this is a hangman game where players can enter a list of words and guess from them. can be played with any amount of players.

serialization is used to save the word bank. if the player saves the game in the menu by inputting "s", the game is saved. when the code is run again and "r" is inputted in the menu, the word bank and the settings are restored. 

would be better if the code only prompted to resume previous game at the beginning, and if there is a game to resume, but thats too much work sorry
